It'd be great to use this repo to have a script that uses tidyverse to make the "wide" Pescadero plankton (and/or benthic) sorting datasheets into "long" format for analyses

Bethany agrees, Stace wonders if we can call a Google sheet into R using something from the readr package? Decided not to use the googlesheets package but rather to pull in from excel.

In order to make a website:
Create a new branch and call it gh-pages. 
Create a new R markdown and call it index.Rmd
Knit the index.Rdm to creat the html

Check the markdown document for the code, or view the knitted html at this url: https://bfleming154.github.io/collab-whoi/
